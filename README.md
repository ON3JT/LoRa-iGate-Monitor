# Introduction

I had had a Lora igate active for some time, but felt that the data from other igates was shown faster or more on sites such as aprs.fi, aprsdirect.de, ...  
But I didn't really have an idea where to start. Until a certain day in July 2022.

Our holiday was over and on the way back to Belgium from Italy we stopped at a motorway car park in Germany. When I went to see where the tracker had been picked up, I saw an igate with a url in it. This made me curious. Just clicked on the link and it was just what I was looking for.

The link : https://aprs.prgm.org/lora-aprs/db0lj.php

Back home, I emailed the site owner asking how he had created this and if I could use some of the code. Unfortunately, the code was not usable but I now had a direction I could work towards.
